        <ul>
            <li>
                <p> West's third studio album, Graduation, garnered major publicity when its release date pitted West in
                    a
                    sales competition against rapper 50 Cent's Curtis.[64] Upon their September 2007 releases,
                    Graduation
                    outsold Curtis by a large margin, debuting at number one on the U.S. Billboard 200 chart and selling
                    957,000 copies in its first week.[65] Graduation continued the string of critical and commercial
                    successes by West, and the album's lead single, "Stronger", garnered his third number-one hit.[66]
                    "Stronger", which samples French house duo Daft Punk, has been accredited to not only encouraging
                    other
                    hip-hop artists to incorporate house and electronica elements into their music, but also for playing
                    a
                    part in the revival of disco and electro-infused music in the late 2000s.[67] His mother's death in
                    November 2007[68] and the end of his engagement to Alexis Phifer[69] profoundly affected West, who
                    set
                    off for his 2008 Glow in the Dark Tour shortly thereafter.[70]</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p> "Jesus Walks", the album's fourth single, reached the top 20 of the Billboard pop charts, despite
                    industry
                    executives' predictions that a song containing such blatant declarations of faith would never make
                    it to
                    the
                    radio.[50][51] The College Dropout was certified triple platinum in the U.S., and garnered West 10
                    Grammy
                    nominations, including Album of the Year, and Best Rap Album (which it received).[52] During this
                    period, West
                    founded GOOD Music, a record label and management company that housed affiliate artists and
                    producers,
                    such as
                    No I.D. and John Legend,[53] and produced singles for Brandy, Common, Legend, and Slum Village.[54]

            <li>
                <p> West invested $2 million and took over a year to make his second album.[55] West was inspired by
                    Roseland NYC
                    Live, a 1998 live album by English trip hop group Portishead, produced with the New York
                    Philharmonic
                    Orchestra,[56] incorporating string arrangements into his hip-hop production. Though West had not
                    been
                    able to
                    afford many live instruments around the time of his debut album, the money from his commercial
                    success
                    enabled
                    him to hire a string orchestra for his second album Late Registration.[56] West collaborated with
                    American film
                    score composer Jon Brion, who served as the album's co-executive producer for several
                    tracks.[57][58]
                    Late
                    Registration sold over 2.3 million units in the United States alone by the end of 2005 and was
                    considered by
                    industry observers as the only successful major album release of the fall season, which had been
                    plagued
                    by
                    steadily declining CD sales.[59]</p>

                <p> West recorded the remainder of the album in Los Angeles while recovering from the car accident. It
                    West added new verses, string arrangements, gospel choirs, and improved drum
                    programming.[38] The album was postponed three times from its initial date in August 2003,[45][46]
                    and
                    was
                    eventually released in February 2004, reaching No. 2 on the Billboard 200 as his debut single,
                    "Through
                    the
                    Wire" peaked at No. 15 while on the Billboard Hot 100 chart for five weeks.[47] "Slow Jamz", his
                    second
                    single,
                    featuring Twista and Jamie Foxx, became the three musicians' first No. 1 hit. The College Dropout
                    received
                    critical acclaim, was nominated for the top album of the year by American Music Awards and
                    Billboard,[48][49]
